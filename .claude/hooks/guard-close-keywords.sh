# PreToolUse(Bash) guard for CLAUDE.md's close-keyword invariants.
#
# Why this is a guard and not a nudge: both halves of the rule are
# mechanically decidable, and CLAUDE.md's own policy says a mistake that
# can be made structurally impossible should be, rather than left to an
# agent to remember. GitHub scans commit messages and PR bodies for close
# keywords and ignores backticks and surrounding prose, so a quoted
# `Closes #150` fires exactly like a live one.
#
# PROVENANCE: ported from the sibling GridPulse repo, where this trap bit
# twice on 2026-05-29 — a commit written to *document* a bad close-reference
# re-closed the very issue it had just reopened, because its message quoted
# the keyword. It has NOT yet bitten sift. It is installed here anyway
# because the behaviour is GitHub's rather than that repo's, and sift
# authors close keywords regularly (16 in the last 250 commits). A rule this
# repo borrows rather than earned; if it ever fires on a real case here,
# that occurrence belongs in .mistakes/worklog/ as sift's own evidence.
#
# Scope is deliberately narrow: only commands that actually write a commit
# message or PR body. Read-only commands that merely mention a keyword
# (git log --grep, gh pr view) are none of this guard's business.
#
# Two decisions, deliberately split:
#
#   backticked keyword -> deny.  Quoting a close keyword is a statement of
#     intent NOT to fire it, and GitHub fires it anyway. There is no case
#     where the author wanted both the backticks and the closure, so this
#     is one of the rare hooks that can be certain. It blocks, and the
#     message carries both escapes (drop the backticks, or break the
#     pattern) so it is never a dead end.
#
#   plain `Closes #N` -> ask.  Legitimate and common; the rule only
#     requires that a human verified the number. Denying it would train
#     people to switch the hook off.
#
# The split exists because "ask" turned out not to gate anything in
# permissive or auto-approving sessions — measured 2026-08-18, the guard
# returned ask on a live reference and the command ran with no prompt. A
# guard whose decision has no force in the mode you actually work in is
# the configured-and-inert failure one layer up, so the case that can be
# decided with certainty now denies.

GitHub scans commit messages and PR bodies for close keywords and ignores backticks, code spans and surrounding prose. Quoting one does not make it inert; this is the trap that re-closed an issue on 2026-05-29 in the sibling GridPulse repo, in the very commit written to document it. See CLAUDE.md -> 'Mistake logging & rule graduation'.

Rewrite the message one of two ways, then re-run:
  - You DO mean to close ${REFS}: verify with 'gh issue view <N> --json title,state', then drop the backticks so the intent is plain.
  - You are only REFERRING to it: break the pattern — write the keyword and the number non-adjacently, or use a #NNN placeholder.

To flip issue state, use 'gh issue reopen|close <N>' — a keyword edit cannot undo a keyword."

# Case 2 — a live reference. Legitimate and common, so this asks rather
# than blocks: the rule only requires that a human verified the number,
# and a wrong one closes the wrong issue and corrupts the roadmap.
emit_decision live ask "This will close ${REFS} on merge.

Verify every close reference before writing it: 'gh issue view <N> --json title,state', and confirm the title matches this work. A number written from memory closes the wrong issue and leaves the right one open (in GridPulse: PR #165 said 150 when the issue was 148).

Confirm you have verified ${REFS} — or cancel and check."
